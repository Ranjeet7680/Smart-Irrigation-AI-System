
    Dataset Description: Smart Irrigation System
    ============================================
    
    This dataset contains synthetic agricultural and weather data for irrigation prediction.
    
    Fields:
    -------
    1. Date: Date of observation
    2. Crop_Type: Type of crop (Wheat, Rice, Cotton, Maize, Sugarcane)
    3. Soil_Type: Type of soil (Clay, Sandy, Loamy, Silt)
    4. Temperature_C: Temperature in Celsius (15-45°C)
    5. Humidity_Percent: Relative humidity (20-90%)
    6. Rainfall_mm: Rainfall in millimeters (0-100mm)
    7. Soil_Moisture_Percent: Soil moisture level (5-50%)
    8. Irrigation_Needed_Liters: Target variable - Water needed for irrigation (0-80 liters)
    
    Data Generation Logic:
    ----------------------
    - Base water requirement varies by crop type
    - Temperature increases water need
    - Higher humidity reduces water need
    - Recent rainfall reduces irrigation requirement
    - Low soil moisture increases water need
    - Soil type affects moisture retention
    
    Use Case:
    ---------
    This data is used to train an ML model to predict optimal irrigation amounts
    based on environmental conditions and crop requirements, promoting water conservation
    and sustainable agriculture practices.
